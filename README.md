```clojure
(ns readme
  "Readme for meerkat")
```


## Background

Large language models (LLMs) are cool, and as a Clojure programmer, I want to try them. However, most libraries are in Python. 

I could switch to Python to take advantage of the ecosystem, but I really miss Clojure's functional style.

Meerkat is my attempt to understand and practice (supporting OpenAI only for now).
